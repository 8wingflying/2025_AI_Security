# Generative AI in Cybersecurity
- (1) Threat Detection and Analysis
- (2) Phishing Detection and Respons
- (3) Incident Response
- (4) Security Automation
- (5) Cyber Forensics
- (6) Chatbots
- (7) Penetration Testing
- (8) Security Protocols Verification
- (9) Security Training and Awareness:
  - LLMs can generate training materials tailored to an organization’s needs.
  - They can also simulate phishing attacks and other security scenarios to train employees to recognize and respond to security threats
